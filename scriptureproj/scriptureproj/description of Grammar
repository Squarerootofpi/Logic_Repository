Propositions

P: propositionID
AD: This is an atomic description that should not be negated, and simplest form. If a proposition is not atomic, it must be broken up.
ED: Extra user description.
Dependencies: propositionID1 propositionID2 propositionIDn

Axioms
#these are claims that you just say are true.
